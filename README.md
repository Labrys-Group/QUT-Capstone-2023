# QUT-Capstone-2023

Welcome! This is the repository where work on the `MembersOnly` application will take place.

This README.md should be updated constantly to reflect the state of the application - that is, what code is in here, and how to run it.

# Repository Structure

> ❗️ IMPORTANT 
> Any merges into the main branch will require a PR first. So, create a new branch for your work, put it up for Code Review - before it's pushed here.

### app/

The app folder will be where the code for the NextJS application will be.

To get started with nextjs - read [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).

Once you've populated the `app/` folder with a NextJS application - come back here and update this description 😉

The design for the front end is [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/7UB73xYEJODrUIKVBBBa8q/MembersOnly?node-id=1-2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2).

** We will deploy this app to Vercel once it's set up here a bit more **

### contracts/

The contracts folder will be a hardhat project - where all smart contract development and testing will take place.

To get started with hardhat - read [here](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview).

Once you've populated the `contracts/` folder with a valid hardhat application - come back here and update this description 😉
